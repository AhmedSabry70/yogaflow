# ü§ù Contributing to YogaFlow

We welcome contributions to the YogaFlow project! Whether you're a core team member or a future external collaborator, your input is valuable. To maintain code quality, ensure legal clarity, and streamline our development process, please follow these guidelines.

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Important: Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**All contributors, including core team members, must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their first code contribution can be merged.**

The CLA ensures that the YogaFlow Team retains the necessary rights to manage, use, and distribute the project's code, protecting both the contributors and the project itself.

* **How to Sign:** Please contact [your.email@example.com] to receive a copy of the CLA and instructions on how to sign it. Your contribution will only be reviewed and merged after your signed CLA is received.

## üìù How to Contribute

1.  **Read the Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with the project's [RPD_Document](docs/RPD_Document.md) and [Architecture Design](docs/Architecture_Design.md).
2.  **Report Bugs/Suggest Features:**
    * Before opening a new issue, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
    * For bugs, use our [Bug Report Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

3.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the `YogaFlow` repository on GitHub.

    * `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
5.  **Make Your Changes:**
    * Ensure your code adheres to our coding standards (we'll define these later, or add a linter).
    * Add appropriate tests for your changes.
    * Update documentation (e.g., API docs) if your changes affect it.
6.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    * Write clear and concise commit messages.

    * Ensure all tests pass and that your CLA is signed.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Standards

(Optional, but highly recommended for teams)
* We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
* We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with a specific configuration for linting.
* All new features should have corresponding unit/integration tests.
